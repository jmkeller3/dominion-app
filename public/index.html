        <h2>What is it?</h2>
        <p>
          The Dominion Kingdom Builder Web App is designed to allow users to
          search and filter through all the dominion card game expansions and
          saved them to personal lists. Each list is shared with the community
          so other users can be inspired for new and creative games.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dominion was designed by Donald X. Vaccarino in 2008 as an innovative
          card game where players build up their simple starting deck of cards
          through ten interchangeable kingdom cards. Ten years later, there are
          now over a dozen expansions, totaling over 400 cards which are all
          compatible with one another. Thus, it can become difficult choosing
          which cards to use.

        <h2>How does it work?</h2>
        <p>
          A user only needs to sign-up if they want to save their own lists.
          Otherwise, they can click the cards page and search through the
          hundreds of cards Dominion offers. Upon registering an account, a user
          simply double-clicks or drags their preferred cards to the card list.
          They can click the card on the list to remove it. Once ten cards are
          selected, they can save their list as a future kingdom to play
          through.

          What makes the Dominion Kingdom Builder App unique is its use of
          Qvist's card rankings which uses feedback from online Dominion
          players. You can read more about this ranking system
