          <h2>What is it?</h2>
          <p>
            The Dominion Kingdom Builder Web App is designed to allow users to
            search and filter through all the dominion card game expansions and
            saved them to personal lists. Each list is shared with the community
            so other users can be inspired for new and creative games.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dominion was designed by Donald X. Vaccarino in 2008 as an
            innovative card game where players build up their simple starting
            deck of cards through ten interchangeable kingdom cards. Ten years
            later, there are now over a dozen expansions, totaling over 400
            cards which are all compatible with one another. Thus, it can become
            difficult choosing which cards to use.

          <h2>How does it work?</h2>
          <p>
            A user only needs to sign-up if they want to save their own lists.
            Otherwise, they can click the cards page and search through the
            hundreds of cards Dominion offers. Upon registering an account, a
            user simply double-clicks or drags their preferred cards to the card
            list. They can click the card on the list to remove it. Once ten
            cards are selected, they can save their list as a future kingdom to
            play through.
          </p>
          <p>
            What makes the Dominion Kingdom Builder App unique is its use of
            Qvist's card rankings which uses feedback from online Dominion
            players. You can read more about this ranking system
