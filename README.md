# Dominion Kingdom App

An application to search, save, and share the best comination of Dominion cards for creative and fun game nights. 

## Motivation
I wanted a service that would allow me to search through the hundreds of cards of Dominion through various 
filters and save them for future games. I also wanted to incorporate a ranking system for each card since certain 
cards are much more powerful than others.
